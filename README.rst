Applications want to send messages to other endpoints.  They don't want
discover the other endpoint, format the payload of the message to the
specified format, adjust message metadata, connect, and send the message.
Sending a message is the most basic concept in distributing computing.
Why do we make it so difficult?

This library makes sending a message easy again.  It does this by
providing a simple way to connect application code that produces or
consumes message payloads, library code that knows how to transform a
payload into a message, and a connector to send the message according
to a specific protocol.  The actual protocols are implemented by other
libraries (e.g, `requests`_, `pika`_, etc.).

Wait... Why? What??
-------------------
We already have `requests`_ for sending HTTP requests, `tornado`_
makes it simple to consume HTTP messages using a ``RequestHandler``.
There is `pika`_ for AMQP.  `ZeroMQ`_ is embarrasingly easy to use.
Why on Earth do we need to combine them?  Just pick the library for
the protocol in question and use it!

That is a very good point.  Python encourages us to use well-defined,
small, efficient tools whenever possible.  This philosophy is one that
I agree with and `goes back even further`_ to the roots of why UNIX is
the way it is.  So *why did I feel the need to write this library?*
The answer is relatively simple.  We have lots of ways to send and
receive messages but there is no **universal interface** for the simple
act of sending and receiving a message.  That is the problem that this
library is solving.

   Applications want to send and receive messages.  Let's make that
   possible.

Ok... Where?
